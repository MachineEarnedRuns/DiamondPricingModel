# DiamondPricingModel
A model to predict the prices of diamonds based on a dataset of historical wholesale and retail prices of diamonds.

Objective 
You own a diamond store and you need to restock your inventory. You have $5,000,000 planned towards the acquisition of new diamonds. 
You have an authentic rundown of diamonds that were bought from different wholesaler sellers and the costs they retailed for. 
You likewise have a rundown of diamonds that are at presently available on the market, yet this rundown does not include any set prices. 
Rather, you will submit an offer for the diamond and the wholesaler will decide on a binary yes-or-no decision to sell you the jewel at 
that cost. Use your knowledge of historical prices to predict the wholesale price of the diamonds and spend your $5,000,000 in a way that 
you feel yields the most profit.

 Directions 
You have been given two data sets. The “training.csv” dataset contains historical data regarding how much diamonds have sold for both 
the retail price you sell the diamond at and the price you paid for it. You can use this data to train any models you see fit to answer 
the question. The “offers.csv” dataset is the dataset you will provide offers for. Note neither the retail price nor the price you would 
need to pay is present in the offers file.  Also included is a data dictionary explaining the fields in the datasets.
